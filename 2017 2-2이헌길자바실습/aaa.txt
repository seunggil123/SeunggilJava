Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing 
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby 
Nothing on you, baby 
They might say hi, and I might say hey 
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say 
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah) 
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you) 
I know you feel where I'm coming from 
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done 
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun 
On a carousel, so around I spun 
With no direction, just tryna get some 
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun 
And so I lost more than I had ever won 
And honestly, I ended up with none 
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience 
I'm thinking 'maybe I should get it out' 
And I don't wanna sound redundant 
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know 
But never mind that, we should let it go 
Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode 
And all the bad thoughts, just let ;em go, go, go 
Hands down, there will never be another one (nope) 
I've been around, and I've never seen another one (never) 
Because your style, I ain't really got nothin' on (nothing) 
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on? (haha) 
Baby you the whole package 
Plus you pay your taxes 
And you keep it real, while them others stay plastic 
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic 
Stop- now think about it 
I've been to London, I've been to Paris 
Even way out there in Tokyo 
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans 
But you always steal the show 
And just like that girl, you got me froze 
Like a Nintendo 64 
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know 
Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing your name 
And no matter where I'm at, girl you make me wanna sing 
Whether a bus or a plane, or a car, or a train 
No other girl's on my brain, and you the one to blame 
Yeah (laughing) 
And that's just how we do it (laughing) 
And I'ma just let this ride 
B.o.B
